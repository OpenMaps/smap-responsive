A simple, slightly incomplete – but working for its purpose – script for creating an .ico-image with appopriate size (32x32) that modern browsers can read.
Ico-images can be used for the "favicon" shown in the browser's tab. Other formats do not have cross-browser support at the time of writing. Check this at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon
